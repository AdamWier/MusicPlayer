about: Need help to build this on Mac

---

**Summary**
I don't own an Apple device, so I can't build this application for MacOs

**Details**
I would really appreciate it if someone would clone the repository and generate the build for MacOs. It should be as simple as running ```npm install``` from the root folder, and then doing ```npm run dist ```
